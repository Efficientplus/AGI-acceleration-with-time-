Why This Matters

Life’s intelligence does not simply stem from the past or present; it is driven by its constant interaction with the future—the unknown. The future, by its very nature, presents new challenges and uncertainties, which is where life’s adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities emerge.

In essence, intelligence arises as a consequence of life’s interaction with the unknown future. This interaction gives life direction and purpose, as it continuously encounters challenges that it must solve in order to survive. The future, with its unpredictability, provides the focus that drives evolution and adaptation.

However, this dynamic relationship with the future would be ineffective without the crucial feedback loops between the past, present, and future. These feedback mechanisms allow life to learn from past experiences, adapt in the present, and prepare for future challenges. Without these continuous feedback cycles, adaptation would be painfully slow, potentially taking millions of years. These loops are what enable systems—biological or artificial—to learn efficiently and evolve rapidly.

This is why integrating time and acceleration into AGI development is so important. By replicating this natural feedback process and allowing AI to interact with the past, present, and future in real-time, we can build systems that are not just reactive but also capable of proactively anticipating and solving future challenges.
